# MiniMerc

## UPDATE ## 
There are some edits being made to the files here. If you are currently working on or thinking about building a Mini Merc please wait. If you have any questions about what changes are being made feel free to hit me up on discord at @slimohan


The Mini Merc project is designed to use all of the existing ZeroG Nebula motion system but in a small 180x180 build size. Both the printed and full metal gantry parts are compatible, as well as Hydra. All the credit goes to the team at ZeroG for designing such an awesome printer, and to flow4enol for the initial frame design.

It uses the Annex K3 MIC6 bed and a custom Annex K3 heater from Keenovo. When ordering the heater make a note on the order page that you want the Annex K3 ZeroG wire exit and they will know what to do. Johnny at Keenovo will handle it from there.

This project is very much a work in progress so none of the files are final and are subject to change.
